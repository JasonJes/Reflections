it help me because its alot easy to see the differences and i dont have to search in every line of a big code



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
i think in manually i can save memory and also i can know when i really need one and cons maybe the same answer but in the contrary 
and i can chose when its a right moment to do a commit, 




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
i think it deppends of the idea that they have of how the user will delevop the program, sometimes it would be more efficient to have all separately and others have it all in one

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
i can use git log to see the infomration of the commits and git diff to compare them 



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    
because i know that i can fix anything that i could break

for any project that i make
